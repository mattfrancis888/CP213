		  //dynamic or late binding - bindign takes place in exectution 
		  //Such as method overriding (the toString override method is an example too)
		  //late binding does not apply to static, final or private methods. (Since you cannot override these methods)
		  //You can create an identical method with the same name in the child however.
		  //for static, final or private methods, java uses static binding

		    //Upcasting and downcating

//		    Animal animal = new Dog();
//		    Dog castedDog = (Dog) animal
		    //Invalid downcasting that will return ClassCastException:
		    //Animal animal = new Animal();
		   // Dog notADog = (Dog) animal;
		    //you can use instanceof to see if downcasting is legitimate; obj instanceof classname
		    
		    //Upcasting:

		    //dont do i] = new Sale(a[i]);  
		    //do b[i] = (a[i].clone());//The reason this works is because the method clone has the same name in all classes, and polymorphism works with method nam
