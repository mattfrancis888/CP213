		  //Contract between hashCode() and equals()
		  //•It is generally necessary to override the hashCode() method whenever equals() method is overridden
		  //•the general contract for the hashCode() and equals methods  states that equal objects must have equal hash code
		  //If two objects are equal, they MUST have the same hash code
		  //If two objects have the same hash code, it doesn't mean that they are equal
		  
		  
		  //testing:
		  //A program whose only purpose is to test a method is called a driver program
		  
		  //One method often invokes other methods, 
		  //so one way to do this is to first test all the methods invoked by that method, 
		  //and then test the method itself–This is called bottom-up testing
		  
		  // a stub is a way of testing, it returns a value for testing
		  //The precondition of a method states what is assumed to be true when the method is called
		  //•The postcondition of a method states what will be true after the method is executed, as long as the precondition
		  
		  //Overloading is when two or more methods in the same class have the same method name
		  //must have different signatures to be valid
		  // when overloading methods, you cannot have different return types in the same class. AS demonstrated below
		  
		  //constructors:
		  //Like any ordinary method, every constructor has a this parameter
		  
		  //Instance variables are automatically initialized in
		  //Java–boolean types are initialized to false–Other primitives are
		  //initialized to the zero of their type–Class types are initialized to null

		  //WEEK 3 PT 2:
		  //A static method cannot refer to an instance variable of the class, and it cannot invoke a nonstatic method of the class
		  //A static method has no this, so it cannot use an instance variable or
		  // method that has an implicit or explicit this for a calling object–A static method can invoke another static method
		  
		  //Wrapper class
		  //Unboxing:  the process of going from an object of a wrapper class to the corresponding value of a primitive type
		  //t i = integerObject.intValue();
		  //boxing : converting primitive type to wrapper class
