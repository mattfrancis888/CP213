		  //•It is generally necessary to override the hashCode() method whenever equals() method is overridden
		  //•the general contract for the hashCode() and equals methods  states that equal objects must have equal hash code

		  //testing:
		  //A program whose only purpose is to test a method is called a driver program
		  
		  //One method often invokes other methods, 
		  //so one way to do this is to first test all the methods invoked by that method, 
		  //and then test the method itself–This is called bottom-up testing
		  
		  // a stub is a way of testing, it returns a value for testing
		  //The precondition of a method states what is assumed to be true when the method is called
		  //•The postcondition of a method states what will be true after the method is executed, as long as the precondition
		  
		  //Overloading is when two or more methods in the same class have the same method name
		  //must have different signatures to be valid
		  // when overloading methods, you cannot have different return types in the same class. AS demonstrated below
