		  //Such as method overloading
		  
		  //dynamic or late binding - bindign takes place in exectution 
		  //Such as method overriding (the toString override method is an example too)
		  //late binding does not apply to static, final or private methods. (Since you cannot override these methods)
		  //You can create an identical method with the same name in the child however.
		  //for static, final or private methods, java uses static binding
		  
		  //in static methods, if you ahve

		  //public static void announcement( ){System.out.println("Sale class");}
		 
		//class Discount extends Sale
			  //public static void announcement( ){System.out.println("DiscountSale class");}

		    //A class marked final indicates that it  cannot be used as a base class from which to derive any other classe
		    
		    //Upcasting and downcating
		    //Down casting
//		    Animal animal = new Dog();
//		    Dog castedDog = (Dog) animal
		    //Invalid downcasting that will return ClassCastException:
		    //Animal animal = new Animal();
		   // Dog notADog = (Dog) animal;
		    //you can use instanceof to see if downcasting is legitimate; obj instanceof classname
		    
		    //Upcasting:
		    //SaleVariable saleVariable = new SaleVariable() // base class
		    //DiscountSale discountVariable = new DiscountSale("paint", 15,10); //derived class
		     //saleVariable = discountVariable;  or saleVariabl = new DiscoutnSale(..);

		    //CLONING:  https://www.javatpoint.com/object-clonings
		    //clone method: public Sale clone(){return new Sale(this);}
		    //original.clone();
		    
		    //prior to java there were no Covariants; so it was public Object clone(){return new Sale(this);}
		    //Sale copy = (Sale) original.clone();
		    
		    //pitfall: where clones will only work compared to copy constructors
		    //if b[i] contains derived classes of (eg; DiscountSale)
		    //dont do b[i] = new Sale(a[i]);  //will only return a plain Sale object, not a true copy (eg; I don't think you can call the methods of the parent class + you cannot reference it as DiscountSale var;
		    //do b[i] = (a[i].clone());//The reason this works is because the method clone has the same name in all classes, and polymorphism works with method nam
