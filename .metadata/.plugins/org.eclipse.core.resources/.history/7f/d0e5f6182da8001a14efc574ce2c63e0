/**
 * The Rectangle class calculates the area of a rectangle, given the length and width as parameters.
 * Also, an "optional" third parameter, called "units", is used to indicate if a units conversion is required, and if so,
 * the type of conversion. This units conversion specifier is explained as follows:
 * 
 *   ci = Assumes that the length and width values are in centimeters. Area is reported in inches
 *   ic = Assumes that the length and width values are in inches. Area is reported in centimeters.
 *   
 * When the "units" parameter is NOT given, that is, the rectangle class is invoked without this
 * parameter, no units conversion is performed. The Area is calculated as if the length and width are
 * dimensionless.
