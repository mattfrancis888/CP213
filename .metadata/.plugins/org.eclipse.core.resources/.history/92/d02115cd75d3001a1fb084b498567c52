		  //return types cannot be changed when overiding a method
		  //but in java 5+ this can be done with a covarient return type
		  
		  //IMPORTANT:
		 //The access permission of an overridden method can be changed from private in the base class 
		  //to public (or some other more permissive access) in the derived class
		  //BUT it canot e changed from public in the base class to private/more restrictive in the derived class
		  
		  
		  //this can be used to invoke a construcotr, such as in lab 6
		  //Encapsulation and Inheritance Pitfall:
		  //•An instance variable that is private in a base class is not accessible by name
		  //in the definition of a method in any other class, not even in a method definition of a derived class
