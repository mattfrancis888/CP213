		  //IMPORTANT:
		 //The access permission of an overridden method can be changed from private in the base class 
		  //to public (or some other more permissive access) in the derived class
		  //BUT it canot e changed from public in the base class to private/more restrictive in the derived class
		  
		  
		  //this can be used to invoke a construcotr, such as in lab 6
		  //Encapsulation and Inheritance Pitfall:
		  //•An instance variable that is private in a base class is not accessible by name
		  //in the definition of a method in any other class, not even in a method definition of a derived class
		  //An option to acess is is to use mutator methods like the public setters/getters in the parent class
		  
		  //you cannot call multiple supers
		  //it is only valid to use super to invoke a method from a direct parent
		  //Repeating super will not invoke a method from some other ancestor class
		  //super.super.toString() == illegal!
		  
		  //instaceOf vs equals for objects
		  //instanceOf works if parent.equals(child), but not vice versa
		  
		  //getClass() returns the class literaly
