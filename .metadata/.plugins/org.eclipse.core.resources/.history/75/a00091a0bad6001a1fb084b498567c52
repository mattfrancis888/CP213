1.How long, on average, will it take the reactor to meltdown assuming it starts from room temperature (25C) and the rod lengths are 0?
A:Manual 32 Ticks (left alone), Automatic 34 Ticks, Average 33 Ticks
therefore roughly mid 30s of ticks (Both from 25 degrees and rod lengths are 0)


2. How fast can the reactor be brought up to an operating temperature of 600C without having it subsequently meltdown?
A:Manual 29 or 30 Ticks (when left alone), Automatic 27-29 Ticks 
(Both from 25 degrees - 600 degrees approximately and rod lengths of 0)
3.Starting with control rods inserted 50 cm, what's the highest temperature you can start at without the reactor melting down?
A:  929 degrees.
