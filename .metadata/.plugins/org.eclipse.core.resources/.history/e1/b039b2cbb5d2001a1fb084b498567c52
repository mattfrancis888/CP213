		  //•the general contract for the hashCode() and equals methods  states that equal objects must have equal hash code
		  //If two objects are equal, they MUST have the same hash code

		  //A program whose only purpose is to test a method is called a driver program
		  
		  //One method often invokes other methods, 
		  //so one way to do this is to first test all the methods invoked by that method, 
		  //and then test the method itself–This is called bottom-up testing
		  
//		  / a stub is a way of testing, it returns a value for testing
